     Once again, the schedule is a list of movements, where each mov is represented
     as the tuple( TA, TB, AX, AY, BX, BY, PS, PE, ES, EE, TL, LW, TD ), where:
           (00) TA. Integer => Time of the start of the movement.
           (01) TB. Integer => Time of the end of the movement.
           (02) AX. Integer => X-axis of the position at the start of the movement.
           (03) AY. Integer => Y-axis of the position at the start of the movement.
           (04) BX. Integer => X-axis of the position at the end of the movement.
           (05) BY. Integer => Y-axis of the position at the end of the movement.
           (06) PS. Integer => Number of passengers at the start of the movement.
           (07) PE. Integer => Number of passengers at the end of the movement.
           (08) ES. Integer => Battery left at the start of the movement.
           (09) EE. Integer => Battery left at the end of the movement.
           (10) TL. Integer => Movement label.
           (11) LW. Integer => Leeway or time the movement can be delayed.
